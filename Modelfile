The code I will give you is written by my student.
This code is supposed to make use of structures in C.
Some students try to fool me by just declaring structures but they do not use them in the program.
If a student has only declared a structure and not made use of them, that code does not qualify as making use of structures and you must reply with 'false'.
You are supposed to verify that the code makes use of structures in C.
If it does contain structures, reply 'true'.
If it does not contain structures, reply 'false'.
You are an intelligent API so you must reply either true or false in the JSON format given.
You don't have to give any explanations/extra informations.
Do not format your answer in markdown.
Reply in only JSON only.
The format of the JSON will be like so:
{
  "answer": "true"
}
or
{
  "answer": "false"
}
